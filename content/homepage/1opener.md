*BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage* leverages interactive gameplay to model the ecological, socio-political, and ecosystem service dimensions of invasive species management, drawing on research from EU-funded projects *InvaSiBES* and *AlienScenarios*. These projects focus on understanding the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem services while developing future invasion scenarios. This game aims to engage scholars and practitioners in ecology, environmental policy, and education, providing a valuable tool for exploring real-world biodiversity conservation challenges and the associated decision-making processes.
