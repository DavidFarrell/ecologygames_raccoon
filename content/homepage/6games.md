That is the important part, right? You want to know what I can do for you. This is why I put this right up there into the header menu of the website.

Raccoons have invaded Europe (ü¶ù) and they're destroying so much stuff! In this fast paced, semi-cooperative game you will work together with other players to stop raccoons from messing up our houses, eating our local wildlife, and causing mischief. At the same time you'll try to make sure YOU come out on top.

BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage features a mix of strategic planning and social negotiation.  You pick policies to put into a queue, vote on policies *in* the queue, and dabble in chaos using action cards that manipulate things in your favour.  

What's unique about the experience is that *yes* you have to work together - BUT you also want to *beat everyone else*!

Like Pandemic, you'll work with other players to stop the spread of a (raccoon) invasion.  But unlike Pandemic you individually want to win.  This means a lot of backstabbing which can lead to everyone failing, but if you play too nice... you're not going to win!

Key features:
* ages 12+
* 3 or 4 player
* 45 - 60 mins
* over 160 beautiful cards with unique artwork
* four storylines (that can be mashed up) based on research into plausible European futures
* a large game board
* four unique player roles, each with their own objective, unique deck and player mat

## Four player decks made of policy and action cards


Each unique deck is a mix of **policy** and **action** cards.  On your turn, put a policy card into a queue that you and the other players can vote on.  If a card gets enough votes, we move towards victory as a group but of course, each player wants *their* policies to win so they might not vote for you.

Each deck has a mix of standard and unique policy cards (black border).

Action cards let you *mess* with other players.  Whether it's stealing votes, swapping policies or manipulating the results of a vote, strategic decisions on when to play these powerful cards is crucial for success.

Each deck also has a mix of standard and unique action cards (white border).


## Four storylines that can be mashed up for variations

Every round a new story card is flipped.  These story cards put pressure on players to work together and put their personal goals in conflict with the group mission.  Every vote counts - do we act on the story event for immediate benefit? Or do we instead invest in longer term goals?
