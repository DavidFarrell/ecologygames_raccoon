**BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage** is the second of two games developed as part of the EU-funded research projects InvaSiBES and AlienScenarios. These projects explore potential futures in Europe and how they might affect our ability to manage invasive alien species, as well as their impacts on native biodiversity. The aim is to understand effective management strategies for IAS across a range of species type (plants, mammals, insects and marine).

Aimed at the general public. The content of **BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage** is based on outcomes from running the first of the games we developed, [**European BioInvasions RPG** (find out more about that game here)](http://ecologygames.eu/). **BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage** simplifies the complex socio-ecological dynamics of biological invasions while maintaining scientific accuracy in key areas.  In the game, players adopt roles as environmental agencies, hunters, or animal rights lobbyists.  Players each have their own agenda and compete, but if they don't compromise, they will fail to prevent raccoons from causing ecological damage across Europe.
