We developed two games as part of the EU-funded research projects *InvaSiBES* and *AlienScenarios*, which explore the ecological, socio-economic, and future impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity. These projects provided the scientific foundation for two distinct games aimed at different audiences.

The first is a **role-playing game, European BioInvasions**, designed with, and for, policymakers and experts. This game places participants in alternate plausible future European scenarios, where they must collaboratively propose and vote to implement policy solutions. Game masters, acting as scientists and storytellers, guide the players through the ramifications of their decisions, assessing impacts on ecosystems and human health. Through several turns, stepping through time in 5 year increments, real-life policymakers gain insights into managing complex ecological challenges.  This RPG can be used in a workshop setting and supports participants in learning about and creating novel management strategies for invasive species management. 

The second game is the **board game, BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage**, aimed at the general public. The content of this game is based on outcomes from running the European BioInvasions RPG. BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage simplifies the complex socio-ecological dynamics of biological invasions while maintaining scientific accuracy in key areas.  In the game, players adopt roles as environmental agencies, hunters, or animal rights lobbyists.  Players each have their own agenda and compete, but if they don't compromise, they will fail to prevent raccoons from causing ecological damage across Europe.
