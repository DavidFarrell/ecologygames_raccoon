**BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage** is one of two games developed within the EU-funded research projects [*InvasiBES*](https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.50.35466) and [*AlienScenarios*](https://alien-scenarios.org). These projects explored potential futures in Europe and how they might affect our ability to manage invasive alien species, as well as their impacts on native biodiversity. 

Aimed at the general public, the content of **BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage** is based on outcomes from another game we developed in parallel, [**European BioInvasions RPG** (find out more about that game here)](https://europeanbioinvasions.ecologygames.eu/). **BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage** simplifies the complex socio-ecological dynamics of biological invasions while maintaining scientific accuracy in key areas.  In the game, players adopt roles as environmental agencies, hunters, or animal rights lobbyists.  Players each have their own agenda and compete, but if they don't compromise, they will fail to prevent raccoons from causing ecological damage across Europe, and everyone loses.
