Two games were developed from the EU-funded research projects *InvaSiBES* and *AlienScenarios*, which explore the ecological, socio-economic, and future impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity and ecosystem services. These projects provided the scientific foundation for two games aimed at different audiences.

The first is a **role-playing game, European BioInvasions** called, designed for policymakers and experts. This game places participants in future European scenarios shaped by invasive species, where they must collaboratively propose and test policy solutions. Game masters, acting as scientists and storytellers, guide the players through the ramifications of their decisions, assessing impacts on ecosystems and human health. Through iterative sessions, real-life policymakers gain insights into managing complex ecological challenges.

The second game is the **board game, BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage**, aimed at the general public. It simplifies the complex socio-ecological dynamics of biological invasions, allowing players to tackle invasive species across various habitats. The game introduces real species such as the marbled crayfish, common ragweed, raccoons, and Asian hornets, each with unique challenges. By strategically managing these species, players explore ecological trade-offs and decision-making in a hands-on, accessible way.

Together, these games transform complex scientific data and future scenarios into engaging learning experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of the invasive species crisis across academic, policy, and public audiences.
